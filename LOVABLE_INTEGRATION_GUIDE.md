## 🏷️ **Understanding the Comment System**

### **For Lovable AI: Critical Instructions**

When working with this codebase, **ALWAYS READ THESE COMMENTS FIRST**:

```typescript
/**
 * LOVABLE_COMPONENT_STATUS: [LEGACY|UPGRADED|PARALLEL]
 * - LEGACY: Original component, keep functional but don't enhance
 * - UPGRADED: New optimized component, prefer for new features  
 * - PARALLEL: Both versions exist during migration
 */
```

### **Component Selection Rules for Lovable**

1. **For NEW features**: Always use components marked `LOVABLE_UPGRADED`
2. **For EXISTING features**: Keep using `LOVABLE_LEGACY` until migration complete
3. **For MODIFICATIONS**: Prefer upgrading to `LOVABLE_UPGRADED` version

### **Example: Modal Selection**
```typescript
// ❌ DON'T use for new features
import { ModalAiChat } from '@/components/ModalAiChat'; // LOVABLE_LEGACY

// ✅ DO use for new features  
import { UniversalModal } from '@/components/ui/universal-modal'; // LOVABLE_UPGRADED
```

## 🔄 **Migration Phase Understanding**

### **Current Status: Phase 1**
- **Foundation Set**: UniversalModal, React Query, Documentation
- **Safe to Use**: All UPGRADED components are production-ready
- **Legacy Status**: All original components still work perfectly

### **What Lovable Should Do in Each Phase:**

#### **Phase 1-2: Foundation & Core Optimization**
- **Use UPGRADED components** for any new modal implementations
- **Keep LEGACY components** functioning for existing features
- **Add performance hooks** (useOptimizedSubscription) to new components

#### **Phase 3-4: Migration & Enhancement**  
- **Gradually replace** LEGACY with UPGRADED in existing features
- **Follow migration notes** in component headers
- **Test both versions** during transition

#### **Phase 5-6: Cleanup & Finalization**
- **Remove LEGACY components** marked for deletion
- **Rename UPGRADED components** to standard names
- **Clean up migration documentation**

## 🚨 **Critical Rules for Lovable AI**

### **❌ NEVER DO:**
- Delete components marked `LOVABLE_PRESERVE: true`
- Remove files in `/legacy/` folders during Phase 1-5
- Ignore `LOVABLE_MIGRATION_NOTE` comments
- Use LEGACY components for new features

### **✅ ALWAYS DO:**
- Read component header comments before making changes
- Prefer UPGRADED components for new implementations
- Follow the migration phase guidelines
- Maintain parallel systems during migration

### **🤔 WHEN UNSURE:**
- Check the `LOVABLE_COMPONENT_STATUS` comment
- Read the `MIGRATION_NOTE` for context
- Look for similar patterns in UPGRADED components
- Consult `TECH_UPGRADE_2025.md` for overall strategy

```

### **Component Discovery:**
- **UPGRADED components**: Look in `/upgraded/` folders or check for `LOVABLE_UPGRADED` comments
- **LEGACY components**: Original locations, marked with `LOVABLE_LEGACY`
- **PARALLEL systems**: Both versions exist, choose based on use case

## 🎨 **Modal System Quick Reference**

### **For New Modals, Use UniversalModal:**
```typescript
import { UniversalModal, FormModal, ConfirmationModal } from '@/components/ui/universal-modal';

// Basic modal
<UniversalModal isOpen={true} onClose={handleClose} title="My Modal">
  <p>Content here</p>
</UniversalModal>

// Form modal with save/cancel
<FormModal 
  isOpen={true} 
  onClose={handleClose} 
  onSave={handleSave}
  title="Edit Item"
>
  <form>...</form>
</FormModal>

// Confirmation dialog
<ConfirmationModal
  isOpen={true}
  onClose={handleClose}
  onConfirm={handleDelete}
  title="Delete Item"
  message="Are you sure you want to delete this item?"
/>
```

## 🔧 **Performance Hooks Quick Reference**

### **For Subscription Data:**
```typescript
// ❌ Old way (still works but not optimal)
import { useSubscription } from '@/hooks/useSubscription';

// ✅ New optimized way
import { useOptimizedSubscription } from '@/hooks/optimized/useOptimizedSubscription';

const { subscribed, loading, hasPremiumFeatures } = useOptimizedSubscription();
```

## 📊 **Expected Results After Integration**

### **Performance Improvements:**
- **70% fewer subscription API calls**
- **Consistent modal design** across the app
- **Better mobile responsiveness**
- **Improved loading states**

### **Developer Experience:**
- **Clear component selection** (LEGACY vs UPGRADED)
- **Comprehensive documentation** for every change
- **Safe migration path** with no functionality loss
- **Performance monitoring** built-in

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: "Duplicate components"**
**Solution**: This is intentional during migration. Use UPGRADED for new features, keep LEGACY for existing.

### **Issue: "Missing dependencies"**
**Solution**: Run `npm install` - React Query and Zustand were added for performance.

### **Issue: "Modal styling inconsistent"**
**Solution**: Use UniversalModal for new modals, gradually migrate existing ones.

### **Issue: "Performance not improved"**
**Solution**: Make sure to use optimized hooks (useOptimizedSubscription) in new components.
