WHEN ENCOUNTERING MIXED KNOWN/UNKNOWN FOODS:
- Process ALL recognizable foods normally with full nutrition data
- For unrecognized items, create individual entries with needsManualInput: true
- NEVER treat an entire food list as one item due to partial recognition failure
- Parse each food separately and handle individually

EXAMPLES OF PROPER HANDLING:
✓ "apples, bananas, exotic dragon fruit" → 3 separate entries (2 with nutrition, 1 manual)  
✓ "chicken breast, rice, unknown sauce" → 3 entries (2 calculated, 1 manual)
✗ Don''t create one entry called "apples, bananas, exotic dragon fruit"

UNKNOWN FOOD PROTOCOL:
- Set needsManualInput: true for unrecognized items
- Provide realistic default serving size (100-150g for most foods)
- Set calories: 0, carbs: 0 to prompt user input
- Keep original food name from user input')
